Back home, the house party gets dull with no food in the house and 10 feet of snow outside."

He always had more than a bottle or two of Coke waiting for us kids when we came to visit from California. I don't ever remember my Grandfather being without a Coke in his hand, even at meals. He's been gone from us for many years now, but every time I see an elderly, mostly bald, gentleman drinking a Coke, I think of my Grandfather and the wonderful summer vacations we spent at his little store drinking Coke.\""
